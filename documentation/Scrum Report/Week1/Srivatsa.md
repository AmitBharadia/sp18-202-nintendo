#Scrum week 1

#SRIVATSA

* What tasks did I work on / complete?
I did a proof of concept on how to build a game using Phaser Game Engine. I have evaluated it’s compatibilities, dependencies, supported platforms and underlying language.
      

*What am I planning to work on next?
I am planning to meet up with the team and share my findings on Phaser game engine, discuss and come up with a game engine to start with. I will work on understanding existing baseline code and learn one design pattern.


*What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
Waiting for the other team members to complete their POC’s on different game engines to discuss and finalize the game engine.
