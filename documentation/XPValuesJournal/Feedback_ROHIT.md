## Feedback - Rohit Sharma
In week #1, Our team has worked on finding suitable game as our project. We have evaluated scope of several game engines, with the mutual feedback on gathered ideas considering design and implementation, we came up with one game engine on which we will develop our game. Through constant feedback, we are continuously planning to improve, revise our practices and adjust our project going forward.

In week #2, With every new use case/story being created, the team immediately reverted with time-line estimation, firming up requirements as they arose.

In week #3, After integrating individual's work and assigned designed patterns, We got so many bugs and other integration problems. Everybody has reported on the correctness of each other's design patterns and everyone got feedback of their 8 Weeks work. As the end final deadline aproaching, Everyone helped each other and resolved all integration bugs successfully.
