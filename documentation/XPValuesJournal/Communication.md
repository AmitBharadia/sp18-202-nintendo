## Communication - Rachit Chokshi

In Week #1, our team had discussed on what the requirements are and divided the tasks individually. Each of us had planned to explore different game engines and to come up with ideas that could be integrated later. At the end of the week, we've evaluated different game engines based on their complexity, technology stack used and supported platforms. Finally, we've shared our ideas and views about each game engine. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In week #2, we continued working on modules assigned to each of us and started making the final changes. We started integrating the code and correcting errors if any. We are working on integrating class diagrams of different modules into a single project class diagram. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In week #3, we've worked on integration of all the design patterns. There were many bugs created due to integration which we cleared by discussing in detail. We've created a final class diagram for the game and updated UML diagrams as required. We've successfully implemented a fully working game with design patterns by effectively discussing the requirements and implementing them with coordination.
