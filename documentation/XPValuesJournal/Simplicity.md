It’s important that as developers we understand that models are critical for simplifying both software and the software process—it’s much easier to explore an idea, and improve upon it as your understanding increases, by drawing a diagram or two instead of writing tens or even hundreds of lines of code. We as a team drew activity diagram, wireframes, usecase diagram, sequence diagram to bring about this simplicity.

In week #3
We brought about simplicity in our integration methoddology by creating modules. So that there is less dependency and more isolated tasks.
